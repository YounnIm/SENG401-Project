# Movie Review App

This project is a website that allows its user to view movies that have come out and analyse its reviews and its details. Users can also submit there own reviews into the database to let others know what they feel. At the bottom of this review page there will be a summarize button that allows users to send reviews to an LLM to then summarize the feedback from users to a digestable summary highlighting details submitted by multiple users.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functional/Non Functional Requirements

Considering the functional requirements, this app will allow users to log in, allow users to select a movie, allow members to submit movie reviews, and allow users to obtain a summarized description of the movie from the LLM. These are the main functional requirements of the system and are imperative to implement to achieve our goal with our idea.

Essentially our app will:
- Have User Authentication
- Movie Selection
- Review Submission
- Review Summarization


Considering the Non-functional requirements, the app will have a user friendlt UI/UX, will be useable in many different resolutions, display accurate summaries based on stored/user reviews, and be responsive in general. These non-functional requirements are extremely important as they can greatly enhance the users experience (As well as some of these requirements being a necassary part of the project).

Essentially our app will:
- Have User Friendly UI/UX
- Responsive Design
- Accurate Summaries
- Good Performance and Responsiveness
  

## React Information

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
